The contents of this folder relate to the Springboard's Data Science Career Track; specifically my final submission for Capstone Project #2.

Given a set of Wikipedia articles (or by leveraging the Wikipedia API), build a model to cluster the articles based on their content building upon core machine learning techniques including classification, dimension reduction, and matrix factorization. A model such as this will be vital to those interested in clustering, transforming, visualizing, and extracting insights from any unlabeled and unknown dataset. This model would be useful for a number of clients/customers. For example, law enforcement or intelligence services might find this model useful as they investigate documents discovered in a raid or review of forensics information.
