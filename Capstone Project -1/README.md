The contents of this folder relate to the Springboard's Data Science Career Track; specifically Capstone Project #1. 

This project was designed to answer the questions, “Do Americans support U.S. President Donald Trump’s position on immigration and, specifically, what many cite as the separation of families as they try to enter/cross the U.S. border? And do those opinions vary by geographic region?” 
Answers to these questions would be very useful and relevant to political allies and spokespeople—as well as opponents and critics—of the President. 
In addition to increasing our understanding of how Twitter data provides reflections of these sentiments across the country, this information could be used to shape advertising and marketing campaigns, political platforms, policy formulation, etc.
